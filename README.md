I am trying to webscrape

#Url cleaner
This is important such that most of the work is done by the code
user can input just the name of the page or www.page.com or just page.com and the url will be cleaned.

# Shotter function

This function will prompt the user to provide a website, the website will be scraped and screenshot.
If the website does not exit the user will be prompted that url given was bad.
If the browser is closed unexpectedly, the user will be prompted that the browser closed.
All this takes place within a space of 5 seconds.

# what is next?

-better url cleaner
-other scrap functions
-ability for user to chose what to scrap for.

# Possibilities

I could design a webscraper for news headlines that would be connected to a notification channel.
This would provide automatic updates of news headlines.
The possibilities are endless!
